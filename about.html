          <h1>What To Know About Self Driving Cars</h1>
          <p>
            Self-driving cars, also known as autonomous or driverless cars, are
            vehicles that use sensors, cameras, artificial intelligence (AI),
            and other technologies to navigate without a human driver.
          </p>

        <section class="How">
          <h2>How They Work</h2>
          <p>
            Self-driving cars use sensors to create a 3D map of their
            surroundings, including other vehicles, pedestrians, traffic lights,
            and road signs. The car's computer system then processes this data
            to make decisions about steering, acceleration, braking, and
            cruising speed.

        <section class="Benifits">
          <h2>Benifits</h2>
          <p>
            Self-driving cars could potentially reduce traffic congestion, lower
            the number of accidents, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
          </p>

        <section class="levels">
          <h2>Levels of automation</h2>
          <p>
            SAE International defines five levels of automation, from Level 0 to
            Level 5, with Level 5 being full automation. Most vehicles on the
            road today are Level 2, which means they can operate themselves but
            the driver is still responsible for paying attention and taking back
            control if needed.
